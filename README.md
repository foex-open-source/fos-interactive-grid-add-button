<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
    The <strong>FOS - Interactive Grid - Add Button</strong> plug-in is a simple way for adding buttons to the Interactive Grid. Whether it's the toolbar, the actions menu, the row actions menu or the row selection menu, this plug-in allows you to extend all of these components with your own, highly customizable buttons, declaratively.
</p>
<p>
    The plug-in's settings give you fine control over the buttons position (first, last, index), look, icon, and which action should be executed when that button is clicked. You can execute a predefined action (ie. delete row), execute some JavaScript code, trigger an event, put the currently selected row(s) pk value into a page item, or even provide your own actions.
